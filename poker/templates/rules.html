<p><b>Dealing Cards and Betting Rounds</b>
After any initial cards are
dealt, players are usually called upon to act in turn, moving clockwise around the table.<br>

Each player can usually take one of the following actions when it is their turn to act:<br>

<b>Check</b> – To check is to decline the opportunity to open the betting. Players can only check when there is no bet <br>during the current round, and the act of checking passes the action clockwise to the next person in the hand. If all<br> active players check, those players remain in the hand and the round is considered complete.<br>
<b>Bet</b> – Players may bet if no other players have bet during the current round. Once a bet has been made, other players<br> must ‘call’ by matching the amount bet, in order to remain in the hand.<br>
<b>Fold</b> – Players who fold forfeit their cards and cannot win or act again during the current hand.<br>
<b>Call</b> – Players can call if other players have bet during the current round; this requires the calling player to <br>match the highest bet made.<br>
<b>Raise</b> – Players may raise if other players have bet during the current round; this requires the raising player to <br>match the highest bet made, and then make a greater one. All subsequent players are required to call the raise or <br>raise again (‘re-raise’) to stay in the hand.<br>
